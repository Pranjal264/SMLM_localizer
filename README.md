# SMLM_localizer

This is the Git repository for a program program I developed for image reconstruction in a STORM based super resolution microscope, as a part of my PhD


## Setting up

The program was developed in Python 3.8.8. Later versions of Python should be supported but have not been tested yet.
If you are on a later version, give it a try!

I would suggest you use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success) / Miniconda and set up a virtual environment as:

- conda create -n "myenv" python=3.8.8 # replace "myenv" with your desired name.

After setting up the virtual environment, you can install the dependencies as:

- pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

Run the script *GUI_main.py* to call up the GUI
